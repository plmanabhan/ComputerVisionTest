User Story: Redraw Human Face Image

As a user of the image processing service,
I want to submit an image of a human face and receive a redrawn version of the face,
So that I can obtain a new artistic representation of the original face image.

Acceptance Criteria:

The service should accept an image file of a human face through an API endpoint.
The submitted image should be processed using a pre-trained diffusion model.
The diffusion model should generate a redrawn version of the human face.
The redrawn face image should maintain the general structure and features of the original face.
The service should return the redrawn face image as a response to the API request.
The returned image should be in a common image format (e.g., PNG or JPEG).
The service should handle common image formats as input (e.g., PNG, JPEG, BMP).
The service should validate the input image and return an appropriate error message if the image is invalid or not a human face.
The processing time for redrawing the face should not exceed 5 seconds for a 256x256 pixel image.
The service should be able to handle multiple concurrent requests without significant performance degradation.
Note: This user story focuses on the functionality described in the provided sample code. In a real-world scenario, the user story would likely include additional details, such as error handling, performance requirements, and integration with other systems.
